# QR Scanner Flow Validation Test Plan

## Implementation Summary

The QR scanner system has been modified to enforce a strict one-way participation flow:

**Strict One-Way Flow:**
`Not Started` → `Check-in` → `Check-out` → `No More Scanning`

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Updates

#### Check-in Endpoint (`/src/routes/api/activities/[id]/checkin/+server.ts`)
- Added strict enforcement to prevent check-in after check-out
- Added strict enforcement to prevent check-in after completion
- Enhanced error messages with flow guidance
- New error categories: `flow_violation`

#### Check-out Endpoint (`/src/routes/api/activities/[id]/checkout/+server.ts`)
- Enhanced enforcement to prevent check-out after completion
- Improved error messages with flow context
- Added flow violation category for better UX

### 2. Frontend UI Updates

#### QR Status Utility (`/src/lib/utils/qr-status.ts`)
- Added new status category: `flow_violation`
- Updated `ALREADY_CHECKED_OUT` and `ALREADY_COMPLETED` to use flow_violation category
- Enhanced visual feedback with red coloring and stronger vibrations
- Added flow message and advice formatting

#### QR Scanner Component (`/src/lib/components/qr/QRScanner.svelte`)
- Added special flow violation warning display
- Visual flow diagram showing the strict sequence
- Enhanced guidance for blocked scans
- Longer display duration for flow violations

#### Scanner Page (`/src/routes/admin/qr-scanner/+page.svelte`)
- Updated instructions to reflect strict flow control
- Added visual flow diagram in instructions
- Clear explanation of what's not allowed

## Test Cases to Validate

### Case 1: Normal Flow (Should Work)
1. User not started → Check-in (✅ Success)
2. User checked-in → Check-out (✅ Success)
3. User checked-out → No more actions allowed

### Case 2: Duplicate Actions (Should be Blocked)
1. User checked-in → Try check-in again (❌ Blocked - ALREADY_CHECKED_IN)
2. User checked-out → Try check-out again (❌ Blocked - ALREADY_CHECKED_OUT with flow_violation)

### Case 3: Flow Violations (Should be Blocked with Strong Warning)
1. User checked-out → Try check-in (❌ Blocked - ALREADY_CHECKED_OUT with flow_violation)
2. User completed → Try check-in (❌ Blocked - ALREADY_COMPLETED with flow_violation) 
3. User completed → Try check-out (❌ Blocked - ALREADY_COMPLETED with flow_violation)

### Case 4: Invalid Sequence (Should be Blocked)
1. User not started → Try check-out (❌ Blocked - NOT_CHECKED_IN_YET)

## Expected Behavior

### Visual Feedback for Flow Violations
- **Color**: Red background instead of blue
- **Duration**: 7 seconds instead of 5 seconds
- **Vibration**: Strong pattern (400, 200, 400, 200, 400)
- **Sound**: Error sound instead of info sound
- **Special UI**: Flow violation warning box with visual diagram

### Error Messages
- Clear explanation of what went wrong
- Visual flow diagram showing allowed transitions
- Specific guidance on why the action is blocked
- No database operations performed for blocked actions

## Database Safety

The implementation ensures:
1. **No data corruption**: Invalid state transitions are blocked before database operations
2. **Consistent state**: Database only contains valid participation states
3. **Audit trail**: All legitimate state changes are properly recorded
4. **Performance**: Invalid requests are rejected early, reducing database load

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Admin permissions still enforced
2. **Data validation**: QR codes still validated before processing
3. **Activity constraints**: Time and participant limits still enforced
4. **User validation**: Account status checks still performed

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be reverted by:
1. Reverting the API endpoint files to previous versions
2. Reverting the QR status utility updates
3. The frontend will automatically fall back to basic error handling

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing error codes.
